A new custom Jekyll theme for documentation and blogging is out. It is ideal for Open Source Software projects to publish under [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Can I link to HTML hosted in a different GitHub repo? Let's see: [Keats Letter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romanticcircles/rc-tei/master/RC%20ARCHIVE/Editions/A%20John%20Keats%20Letter%20Rediscovered.html/Diplomatic%20Translation.html).

Your contribution is welcome!
