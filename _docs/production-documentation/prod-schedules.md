We'll eventually publish things again. Update as appropriate.

## Production by Section

The RC editorial staff is currently working to regularize production schedules for recurring publications on the site. Currently, the yearly production schedule that RC editors and staff can expect looks something like the following:

- **Editions**: 1–2 editions per year
- **Praxis**: 2–3 volumes per year, one of which is a special
- **Pedagogies**: occasional resource updates, plus annual contest- Galleries: 1–2 exhibits per year, mostly managed by section editor(s)
- **Unbound**: issues published quarterly (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
- **Reviews & Resources**: regular rolling updates, mostly managed by section editors
- **RC Lab**: variable frequency, by proposal

Each published volume of essays involves a specific process according to its section, as outlined through the rest of this section of the documentation. In general, each volume is managed by a specific site manager/technical editor and carried through the entire production process in consultation with the general editors, the section editors, and the volume editor(s).
