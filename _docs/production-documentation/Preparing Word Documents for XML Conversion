###Checklist for Word Document Preparation:###

#Before transforming a word document using Oxgarage, we highly recommend first “cleaning” up the document using the following checklist. These steps will result in an xml doc that is much cleaner and easier to code.#

1. Turn on the “Show/Hide” button in Word's menu bar (it looks like a paragraph symbol) to reveal all hidden formatting in the document.  
  *Also, be sure to use the “find and replace” (cntrl + f) feature to speed up the process. 
2.	Remove all double spaces in doc and replace w/ single spaces (hint, this is a good one to use the “find and replace” feature for).
3.	Replace any hyphens between date ranges with an en dash (“option+hyphen key”)
  *Be careful with the diplomatic transcriptions, please review the facimile first to see if it looks like a simple dash or an em dash before proceeding.
4.	Replace any doube-hyphens (--) with an em dash (“option + shift + the minus sign key”
  *For the bibliography, any “repeat” entries (multiple entries by the same author/contributor) should be indicated by a triple em dash (———)
5.	Convert all footnotes to endnotes
6.	Ensure the document is double-spaced throughout with standard 1” margins. If block quotes and/or poetry excerpts are indented via tabs, restore left margin and then restore indents by changing the margin indent (using either the “increase indent” shortcuts on the Home tab or the ruler; see “f” below).
7. Remove as much extraneous formatting as possible from the file, including different fonts and font sizes, centering of heads and/or excerpts, colors, highlighting, any remaining Track Changes elements or comments, extraneous bolding, etc. In general, the simpler the formatting of the source essay, the easier its conversion to TEI will be.
8.	Remove and turn off all comments in the document. 
9.	Remove any images from the document itself and create placeholder text for yourself so you will remember to include an html link in that location.
