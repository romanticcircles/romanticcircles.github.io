## Final Volume Publication

After all steps contained in the "[Digital Publication Guide](../digital-pub-guide/)" documentation are complete, it's time to publish the volume.

Recall from the [volume proofing process](../vol-proofing/) that you "unpublished" the volume's parent resource / TOC page (Drupal content type: "Praxis Publication" or "Editions Publication"). Simply navigate to this main page, click the "Edit" contexutal tab up top, and check the "Published" box at the bottom of the page.

This action will "activate" the TOC page in the database, and this enables the site's front page slider view (that displays our newest volumes) and the relevant site section view (the Praxis or Editions page) to "find" and display the volume. After publishing, check both of these locations to ensure the views have done their work.

Shortly after publishing the volume, you should send a congratulatory email to the volume editor(s) announcing their volume is published and providing a link to the TOC page for them to share with their contributors, colleagues, etc. You should carbon-copy the relevant section editor(s) as well as the general editors on this message.

## Marketing / listserv copy

RC tech/assistant editors distribute marketing copy to the major listservs in Romanticism and via social media after the publication of new volumes/editions. Normally this copy is derived from the volume abstract, provided by the volume (or occasionally section) editors and adapted to the medium in question (Twitter, e-mail for listserv, etc.). For Twitter, you should also attach the volume's banner image to the post and "tag" any contributors with Twitter accounts. Editors have often "threaded" such announcements on Twitter to make sure all relevant copy can be included in an announcement. To get a feel for how these releases should look, peruse RC's prior announcements on Twitter.

The current info needed to facilitate this distribution is provided/maintained in a private Google doc in the production sync drive, [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6ezv0OsQgVf3DyGrUFCl2fyBUjnm_jPaCOmeV1pYKs/edit?pli=1). If you need permission to access this file, contact a current RC technical/assistant editor.

Past RC editors have found it useful to join the NASSR and BARS mailing lists in order to see when the announcements go out; if several days have passed without an announcement, itâ€™s absolutely appropriate to reach out to remind the listserv managers (who are volunteers!).
