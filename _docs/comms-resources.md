title: Communication & DH Resources

In general, if you have a question or problem with the site or production process you can reach out via Slack to one of the RC assistant/technical editors. If the site managers can't immediately resolve the issue, or if they deem that it needs to be taken to a section or general editor, they will contact the appropriate editor/admin on your behalf.

The following links will aid you in your self-directed learning process. As you start to navigate your way through RC's infrastructure and to learn the many skills needed to manage the site (described in detail the following Production Documentation section), you're going to be consulting various resources on the web to figure stuff out. Usually doing a web search for an issue (often in the form of a specific error message) will get you answers. But sometimes it seems like there's no bottom to what's happening in the Digital Humanities, much less the wider programming community. Here are some resources that have proved useful to others who have come before you.
