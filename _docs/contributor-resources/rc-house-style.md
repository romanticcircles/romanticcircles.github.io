In general, Romantic Circles follows the MLA Handbook (8th edition) on matters of citation style for Praxis and Pedagogies essays and the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition) for RC Editions. This reference document is intended to address stylistic concerns when the MLA guide has no hard-and-fast rules or simply as a set of reminders to avoid common mistakes. On matters of publishing, formatting, usage, and writing style, RC House Style in general defers to the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition.

All typographical issues like dashes, ellipses, typeface, spacing, etc., should be enforced by the copyeditor to allow the TEI encoder to perform an accurate markup of the document.
