title: Jekyll + GitHub Pages Guide
permalink: /docs/jekyll-github/
---

This documentation is written in Markdown, then transformed to HTML by Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator, and finally served by GitHub Pages from a simple git repo hosted on GitHub. Learning to edit and maintain this static site is fairly straightforward, and the site itself is a highly stable, simple, elegant solution to providing, preserving, and sharing the processes and institutional knowledge of one of longest running digital humanities initiatives in literary studies.

An indispensable tool for managing the Jekyll site and authoring/editing its content is a robust text editor; [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our editor of choice, with its built-in file explorer, text editor, git functionality, terminal with shell integrations, and high degree of customizability. It also can be configured to run a Jekyll installation + server on either MacOS or Windows.

The following guide will outline the steps to install Jekyll; outline how the site's logics work to generate a fully functional site from a few simple pages; explain several add-ons to the basic Jekyll site such as theming, search, and menus; and provide a brief tutorial on how to update and maintain the site. This section concludes with a "Markdown Cheat Sheet" for use in editing and authoring new content in the Markdown language.
