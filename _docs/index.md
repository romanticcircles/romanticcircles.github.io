## About Romantic Circles

### Site history and overview

Romantic Circles [romantic-circles.org](https://www.romantic-circles.org) is a scholarly website devoted to the study of Romantic-period literature and culture, often approached through the lens of the present. The site was one of the first digital humanities platforms on the web to focus on literature and literary study. It was launched in late 1996 at the University of Maryland and has operated continuously now for 25 years, generating almost a million site visits each year from all over the world. The University of Colorado Boulder took over as publisher in 2018, with funding for two English PhDs to assume Site Manager and Technical Editor duties.

This handbook is intended to be a living document. It was drafted by CU Boulder’s first technical editors, T. J. McLemore and Cayla Eagon, and revised and expanded by Jessica Tebo. Its aim is to pass institutional knowledge and RC’s often complex technical processes to future editors, managers, and interns to expedite the training process and ensure smooth transitioning and uninterrupted operation of the site.
